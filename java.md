# EXAM: Programming Basics

### Getting Started
 - Fork this repository under your own account
 - Clone the forked repository to your computer
 - Create a `.gitignore` file so generated files won't be committed
 - Commit your progress frequently and with descriptive commit messages
 - All your answers and solutions should go in this repository

### What can I use?
- You can use any resource online, but **please work individually**
- **Don't just copy-paste** your answers and solutions, use your own words instead.
- **Don't push your work** to GitHub until your mentor announces that the time is up

#### Your answer:
[add your answer here]   
1: modifiers: it changes the accessibility of the method.
2: method types: it could be return or void. Here the the type of method is return and it is returning with a double.
3: name of the method
4:the parameter of the method. here it is int type.
5:the name of the int parameter.
6:a temporary double what will be returned at the end of the method.
7:the "heart" of the method is for loop which modifies the returning double.
8:the returning value.

### What is the constructor? When it is used? [2p]
#### Your answer:
[Constructor instantiates a class, it is used when we want to use the methods and paramteres of the istantiated class, so we create a constructor for e.g. class X, and the class X can be instantiated in an other class e.g. class Y. For example, in class Y using the constructor of class X: "(X x = new X();" ]
